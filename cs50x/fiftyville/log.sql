-- | Ruth    | Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the bakery
--    parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the bakery parking lot, you might
--    want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame.                                                          |
-- | Eugene  | I don't know the thief's name, but it was someone I recognized. Earlier this morning,
--    before I arrived at Emma's bakery, I was walking by the ATM on Leggett Street and saw the thief
--    there withdrawing some money.                                                                                                 |
-- | Raymond | As the thief was leaving the bakery, they called someone who talked to them for less
--    than a minute. In the call, I heard the thief say that they were planning to take the earliest
--    flightout of Fiftyville tomorrow. The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone
--    to purchase the flight ticket. |
