Usage: from jar import Jar
Example: jar = Jar(10); jar.deposit(3); print(jar)

This module implements a cookie jar class that can store a limited number
of cookies. Provides methods to deposit and withdraw cookies with proper
capacity validation and error handling.
Uses cookie emoji (üç™) for visual representation.
